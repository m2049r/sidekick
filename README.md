__Turn your old phone into a secure Bluetooth hardware wallet for Monero!__

What if your old phone could act as a secure Bluetooth hardware wallet? Meet Monerujo's Sidekick - your new companion app designed to bring enhanced security to your Monero holdings without breaking the bank.

Sidekick transforms any secondary phone into a virtually air-gapped, offline storage for your private keys, pairing seamlessly with the trusted Monerujo app or other compatible mobile Monero wallets over Bluetooth. Get the security of a hardware wallet, minus the hefty price tag or supply chain risks.

Key Features:

Affordable Security: No need for expensive hardware wallets. Repurpose any old phone and keep your private keys secure.
Offline Protection: Keep your Sidekick phone disconnected from the internet for added safety.
Open Source Transparency: Just like Monerujo, Sidekick is fully open-source, allowing anyone to audit and verify its security.
Easy to Use: Simple Bluetooth pairing between devices makes managing your Sidekick intuitive.
Multiple Wallets: Each Sidekick wallet works like a separate hardware wallet, offering flexibility.
Eco-Friendly: Repurpose existing tech instead of buying new devices, reducing e-waste.

Easy as 1-2-3...4:
- Install Sidekick on your secondary phone.
- Pair both phones via Bluetooth.
- Create a Monero wallet on Sidekick and restore it on Monerujo.
- Use your wallet on your primary phone while authorizing everything on Sidekick.

For Monero users seeking a balance of security, affordability, and convenience, your Sidekick is here to help.
